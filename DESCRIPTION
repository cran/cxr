Description: Recent developments in modern coexistence theory have
    advanced our understanding on how species are able to persist and
    co-occur with other species at varying abundances. However, applying
    this mathematical framework to empirical data is still challenging,
    precluding a larger adoption of the theoretical tools developed by
    empiricists. This package provides a complete toolbox for modelling
    interaction effects between species, and calculate fitness and niche
    differences.  The functions are flexible, may accept covariates, and
    different fitting algorithms can be used.  A full description of the
    underlying methods is available in Garc√≠a-Callejas, D., Godoy, O., and
    Bartomeus, I. (2020) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13443>.  Furthermore, the
    package provides a series of functions to calculate dynamics for
    stage-structured populations across sites.
